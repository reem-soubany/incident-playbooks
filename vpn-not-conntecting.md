# VPN Not Connecting

**Issue:** VPN stuck on connecting or fails authentication

**Quick checks:**

- Check if user can sign into MS365 in a browser

**Fix:**
1. Disconnect & reconnect to VPN
2. If user can't sign into MS365 -> reset password, then retry VPN
3. Re-add VPN profile & ensure accurate VPN settings
4. Use Windows troubleshooting tools in settings to run the network & internet troubleshooter

**Verification:**
- VPN connects after a few seconds

**Evidence:**
- Ticket created: VPN error, action/steps taken
